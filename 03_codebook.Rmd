## Setup
Here, we're just setting a few options.
```{r Setup}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  warning = TRUE, # show warnings during codebook generation
  message = TRUE, # show messages during codebook generation
  error = TRUE, # do not interrupt codebook generation in case of errors,
                # usually better for debugging
  echo = TRUE  # show R code
)
ggplot2::theme_set(ggplot2::theme_bw())
pander::panderOptions("table.split.table", Inf)
```


## Library
```{r Library}
library(labelled)
library(codebook)
library(formr)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

```


## Data
Load selected data based on 02_exclusion
```{r Data}
data_lim_included = read.csv(file = "data_lim_included.csv")[,-1]
```

## Relative Ideal Age 
Ideal long-term partner's age will be be calculated as relative age discrepancy between ideal partner’s age and women’s own age which will be calculated by subtracting women’s own age from ideal partner’s age
```{r Ideal Age Range}
data_lim_included = data_lim_included %>%
  mutate(ideal_age_rel = ideal_age - age)
```

```{r}
qplot(data_lim_included$ideal_age_rel)
```

## Create Codebook
```{r create codebook}
codebook(data_lim_included)
```

## Save Data
```{r Save}
data_lim_included_documented = data_lim_included
write.csv(data_lim_included_documented, file = "data_lim_included_documented.csv")
```
